# Connect64

This project is a [C++/CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B/CLI) game created at the midpoint of my software development education. Working with a partner, I helped develop this visual game for our final project int the Program Construction II course. The main focuses of the project were clean, extensible code, good documentation practices, and a solid understanding of C++/CLI

### Playing the game
Once the game is compiled, play is relatively simple. The objective of the game is to create a trail of sequential numbers, from 1 to 64, filling the board without overlap or reuse. Numbers can only be placed above, below, left, or right of the number before it, i.e. 2 can only be placed next to 1, 3 next to 2, and so on. Once all tiles have been placed, a victory sound will play, and, if you qualify, your name will be recorded in the high score list!

There are 12 puzzles included. Each has a different set of pre-determined numbers on the board, requiring you to connect these existing numbers to your number trail.
